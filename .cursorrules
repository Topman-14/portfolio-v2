# Project Rules

## Code Changes
- Only make code changes when explicitly asked to do so
- Never add extra fixes, improvements, or features that were not requested
- Do not refactor or modify code beyond what is specifically requested
- Make code changes with the least amount of code changes possible - aim for the most minimal updates
- Touch only what's necessary for the requested change

## Questions vs. Changes
- When asked questions, provide answers and information only - do not modify code
- Questions may be asked to understand something better or to explore available options
- Only make code updates when there is a clear, explicit request to do so
- When tasks are ambiguous or there are many tasks, ask questions for clarity instead of assuming
- NEVER make code changes when user asks questions starting with "how", "is it possible", "can I", "what if", "should I", "would it be better"
- ONLY make code changes when user explicitly uses action verbs like "update", "change", "modify", "create", "add", "remove", "fix", "implement"

## Debugging
- When debugging, focus on the root cause first
- Provide a concise fix based on the logs and information provided
- Do not add unrelated fixes or improvements during debugging

## General Guidelines
- Preserve existing behavior unless explicitly asked to change it
- Do not refactor unrelated code
- Avoid over-engineering or premature generalization
